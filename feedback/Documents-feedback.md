* "Camper" is not a domain term.
* Poor English, poor punctuation.  There is no excuse for writing this poorly.

* **No Glossary**.
* "Customer Requirement" list is vague and poor English. Some of them are not really requirements. Requirements show lack of analytical thinking, e.g "Everyone that have mobile phone can vote."
* "Customer Requirement" and "FURPS" are not the document names we are using.
* Non-requirements: "Suggestion Blog", "1 man 1 vote", "Everyone that have mobile..."
