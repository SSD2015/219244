### Demo

* [ ] Application runs and shows significant work done.
* [ ] How much work done to achieve goals in EL1 Plan? If they didn't reach a goal, they have a good explanation why that shows effort.
* [ ] Do the UI screens in demo correspond with what's in mock-up?
    * Doesn't have to look the same, but screen contents and screen flow should be close match.

### Github

* [ ] Code on Github is up-to-date.
* [ ] Can you checkout their code and run it?
* [ ] Have they been using Github continuously? Use Github Graph. 0 = uncommitted work for EL1. 1 = they wait 'til the end to commit most work, 5 = many commits throughout iteration.
* [ ] **Every team member** is assigned several tasks and closing them.
* [ ] **Every team member** has multiple commits. (Balanced workload.)

Can't easily judge effort by looking at number of files or lines of code.  The person who generated project in Play will get a big number for no work.

### Work and Process

* [ ] Are there Github Milestones that match Milestones in _Iteration Plan for EL1_?
* [ ] Good Milestones? (Mark progress toward completing iteration and are verifiable done or not done)
* [ ] Work (tasks) are recorded as issues.  _Is there significant work that's not recorded as issue?_
    * As a test, pick some work product and which issues produced it.
* [ ] Tasks are described well enough that you understand them; each task indicates what the assignee should do or produce.
* [ ] Are most tasks associated with Milestones?

### Documentation
* [ ] Well organized, easy to find, and has these parts:
    * Use Cases
    * Supplementary Requirements
    * Mock-up
    * Glossary
    * Vision
    * **Not** "Customer Requirements" or "FURPS" (JDED, and poorly written)
* [ ] Use Cases and Supplementary Requirements are up-to-date and well written?
* [ ] Are important terms clearly defined in Glossary? 
    > "Rating" - assign a score or scaled assessment to an _entrant_ for a specified criterion.
    > "Vote", "Voting" - select one _entrant_ for a criteria, such as "Best project".
    > "Entrant", "Contestant", "Project" - term for entrants or contestants that are being voted/rated.
* [ ] Do they have any software design document(s) that describe important decisions or findings?  
    > Examples are: Frameworks comparison, design of how vote items (questions) are stored and retrieved.
