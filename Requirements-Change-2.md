I emailed and spoke to Aj. Panpiti to clarify some requirements.
This is one of them.

**Question:** Should a voter be allowed to submit a partial vote? That is, can he elect to not score some teams for some criteria?

Aj. Panpiti's Answer:

**Requirement Change:**

1. Voters are not required to evaluate all contestants (teams) before submitting their vote.
2. For contestant (team) evaluation items, there should be a choice that means "no vote" or "no score" for that item.
3. Because of item 1 above, voters should be allowed to vote on "choose-1" items (like "Best Project") without evaluating every team.
