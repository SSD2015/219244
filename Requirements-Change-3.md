I emailed and spoke to Aj. Panpiti to clarify some requirements.
This is one of them.

**Question:** should a voter be allowed to retrieve his vote, modify it, and resubmit it while voting is still open?

Aj. Panpiti's Answer:

> I think voters should be allowed to review their votes and change until they submit the final vote. 
> However, it is hard to tell when result should not be allowed to change.  My best requirement should
> be: a voter can evaluate one group at a time; he/she can edit all answers and review before his/her
> final decision; and there will be no change after final decision. 

He also remarked:

> Well, I found lots of statistically unfair issues in this voting system; however, it can be done by
> regulation of voting.  But I think we can leave that for the students to (hopefully) think about.
> I suggest that students should write full voting regulations and do a field test with that.

**Requirement Update:**

As Aj. Panpiti wrote, the application should

1. Allow voter to review and modify his vote(s) at any time and any order.
2. System should ask voter for confirmation before final submission. 

I also think it's highly desirable to have a "Save" function, so user can save his votes so far without submitting them.  Consider this scenario:

* Voter wants to vote so he authenticates via a web browser on a laptop.
* Voter enters his votes for several contestants.
* Voter realizes there is a contestant (or contestants) that he has not seen yet!
* Voter **saves** his vote, logs out, and goes to review remaining contentants.
* Voter logs in again. The system shows his saved vote and he continues voting.
