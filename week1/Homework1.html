<H1>Homework 1</H1>

<p>
You will obtain background info about a POS for small business by interviewing
someone from a small business.  You can do this alone or ''work with one other
person''. If you work with a partner, submit one copy of your results with both
your names.



<h2>1. Assignment for Business using POS</h2>

<ol>
<li> What is the name and location of the business? What is the name of person you interviewed?
<li> What is the nature of the business?
<li> What functions are performed by their POS? (for example, making sales, manage inventory,
making refunds, compute total sales for each day)
<li> How does he/she use the POS to make a sale?
<li> If the owner agrees, take a photo (or screendump) of POS.  Include photo in your report and annotate it to describe what is on the screen.
<li> What external systems or hardware does POS use? For example, does it perform credit card verifcation, connect to printer, connect to back-end system for product info?
<li> What does the business feel are pros and cons of their POS?
<li> What features would they like to have or see improved in a POS?
<li> Include other relevant questions you think of.
</ol>

<h2>2. Assignment for Business Not using POS</h2>

<p>
As a researcher, you are looking for <u>likely</u> opportunities for a POS.
Some small businesses are very unlikely to want a POS because it doesn't add
value and doesn't fit into their "work flow". For example, a laundary,
a barber shop (unless there are several employees), 
fish or vegetable sellers at a flea market. Avoid unpromising businesses.
</p>
<p>
For a business not using a POS, using a mock-up of your ideas
(or get them to help draw a mock-up) might help.
They may not see any benefit of a POS until they have 
a visual idea of what a POS might do.
But, you don't want to bias their thinking so don't show your
own mockup right away. ''Seek first to understand''.

<ol>
<li> What is the name and location of the business? What is the name of person you interviewed?
<li> What is the nature of the business?
<li> If the owner agrees to specify, what is their approximate weekly (or monthly) sales total?
<li> What is the reason for not using a POS?
<li> How to they perform sales and compute prices?
<li> This question will help identify <em>opportunity</em> for our POS: 
<br>If there was a <em>free</em> mobile POS that runs on smart phone or tablet computer, would he/she consider using it in their business?
<li> If "yes" to above, what important feature or characteristic should a POS have to make them want to adopt it?
<li> If "no" to above, why do they think its not useful?
<li> Include any other questions you ask.
</ol>

<h2>Report</h2>
<p>
Write a short report for both businesses, on separate papers.
<ol>
<li>
At the top of each report, write the business name, location,
name of person you spoke to, and description of the business.
<li>
Summarize the answers to the questions you asked.
<li>
For business using a POS, include a photo or screenshot of
their POS. 
Please annotate the image to show what the components
on the screen do and how to make a sale.
<li>
For the business not using a POS, if they thought your mock-up
was promising and gave feedback, include your mock-up in report.
<li>
What is your conclusion? Does this business represent an
opportunity for a mobile POS? Why or why not? What are the
important factors? What are the barriers, competition, or
threats to writing a POS for this kind of business?
</ol>

<h2>Profile Assignment for Everyone</h2>

<p>
Create a profile of yourself on the class wiki, 
<a href="http://se.cpe.ku.ac.th/wiki">http://se.cpe.ku.ac.th/wiki</a>.
<ol>
<li>Login to wiki using your KU login.</li>
<li>Go to the students page.</li>
<li>Click on your name. If the wiki page doesn't exist yet, a new page is
opened in editor. If an existing page, it is displayed. (click on "edit" to modify it)
<li>Create a page containing:
<ul>
   <li>your name and nickname
   <li>photo clearly showing your face
   <li>your interests. On open-source sites, interests are used to find developers to
       work on a project, so include both computer-related and non-computer interests.
   <li>projects you have worked on: one sentence describing the project and your role.
       If project artifacts are online, include a hyperlink.
   <li>link to your personal web site or blog, if you have one.
</ul>
There is an example page on wiki.
<li>Save and preview your page.
</ol>
