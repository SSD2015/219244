<h2>3. Characteristics of Bad Requirements</h2>

<p>The OpenUP documentation lists these "Requirements Pitfalls".
<ul>
<li>Ambiguous. Requirement is not clearly stated.
<li>Multiple requirements written as one. "and", "or", "but"
<li>Exceptions or "escape clause". Requirements containing wording
such as "unless ...", "except when ...", "if", "but", "although".
<li>Long sentences or references to other documents. Lead to errors.
<li>Premature Design. Requirements that specify implementation
or design details, such as input details, database fields.
<li>Mixing different kinds of requirements in one.
<li>Vague, undefined terms such as "easy to use", "user friendly",
"approximately".
<li>Cannot be verified or impossible to achieve. Such as "system should never crash".   Even if the system is error-free, how can you verify this?
</ul>

What is wrong with each of these requirements? Write a reason and rewrite the requirement to be better.
<ol>
<li>The POS can be used on any tablet computer with at least 1GB of memory.
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>The POS should run on many kinds of tablet computer.
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>The user can search for a product in inventory.
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>In search function, the POS searches the Inventory database for UPC code and returns matching products quickly.
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>Authorized users can override product price in sale by clicking on "Edit" button.
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>POS should be easy to use.
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>POS licensee can purchase software installation and training from SKE student group. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>POS should support payment authorization using Kasinkorn Bank mobile payment attachment (device), and issue receipt by sending email to customer.
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>

</ol>

on se has more detail).

<h2>How to Discover Requirements?</h2>

<p>
Some techniques for discovering requirements are:
<ul>
 <li>Interview users
 <li>Brainstorming and workshops involving stakeholders
 <li>Observation. Observe people using system (or performing task system will do)
 <li>Work in the target environment yourself!
 <li>Demonstrate prototype to stakeholders.
 <li>User complaints and suggestions.
 <li>Unintended uses of existing app. This may be a source of innovation.
 <li>Examine similar or competing products.
</ul>

<h2>4. Interview Preparation</h2>

<p>
Next week you will meet the co-CEO of Winner Telecom 
(www.winnertelecom.co.th). Winner already has a POS,
so her roles are (a) product expert, (b) stakeholder.
The "product owner" for this project will be the instructors
(Jim and Sirisilp).  It is quite common in software projects
that the customer designates someone to act as representative.
</p>
<p>
Write <em>at least</em>
5 questions you would like to get the answer to during
the interview next week.
